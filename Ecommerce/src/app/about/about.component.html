            The right background for your images is so important to create and enhance the mood of your subject. The background you choose should have the same aesthetic as your product, or it won’t look right. For example, if you shoot an ultra-modern piece of tech and choose a rustic, country-style background, it will be jarring and distract from the product. Or putting a natural, botanical skincare product on an industrial metal-type background. It just wouldn’t look right - I’m sure you get the idea! Sometimes the best backdrops are simple, single colour pieces of paper or cloth. Adding different textures like wood or metal (even wallpaper samples) can really enhance your food or product and help tell your story. Avoid clashing colours and distracting patterns, too. One of the most economical ways to get great colours and textures on your backdrops is to invest in some flat lay backdrops that you can use again and again. The Spectrum Flat Lay Backdrops come in a range of looks, from beautiful marble to textured concrete. Each flat lay backdrop is reversible, so you get two backdrops for the price of one!
